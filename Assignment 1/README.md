## Part 1 : File Encryption

Create a program which can encrypt and decrypt a text using the AES algorithm with a given IV.

Extend Part 1 to hide the IV. This involves saving the IV within the encrypted file and extracting it in the decryption stage.

## Part 3 : Salt

Create a key from the password using a salt and iteration count to further secure the message.

Extend Part 3 to include metadata about the file. Include a logger.
