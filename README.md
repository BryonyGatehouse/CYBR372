# Applications of Cryptography

Cryptographic mechanisms are widely deployed for communication and data protection. This course addresses how cryptographic mechanisms can be effectively used within larger security systems and how cryptographic mechanisms can be vulnerable in deployed systems. Topics covered include cryptographic primitives, cryptographic protocols, cryptanalytic techniques on primitives and protocols in deployed systems and attacks based upon common errors in use of libraries. Practical work will include best practice use of cryptographic libraries and attacks.

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:
1. Describe the security properties and different application areas of common cryptographic primitives and protocols.
2. Analyse, evaluate and correctly use the most appropriate cryptographic libraries to implement specified data protection requirements or security protocols.
3. Use cryptanalytic techniques and tools to analyse and identify security vulnerabilities in the implementation of data protection and security protocols.
